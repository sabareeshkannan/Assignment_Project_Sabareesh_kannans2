# Ideas & Selection Rationale

Assignment Project
- Idea 1: MealPrepped — Weekly meal planner, shopping list, expiry reminders, overall spending and current inventory dashboard, and a small "what to cook next" recommender.
- Idea 2: Health and Fitness Tracker — Track workouts, set goals, monitor progress.

Chosen: MealPrepped  
Reason: It solves a real pain point for me and is easy to test in daily life. The app naturally supports CRUD operations, dashboards, and a small ML recommender feature, which I find technically interesting as well.
